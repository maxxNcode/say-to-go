## Important Considerations

### HTTPS Requirements

For full functionality, especially voice recognition:
- The Web Speech API requires a secure context (HTTPS)
- Localhost is exempt from this requirement
- Ensure your deployment uses HTTPS in production

### API Keys

The current implementation uses a public Mapillary API key:
- This is suitable for demonstration purposes
- For production use, consider obtaining your own API key
- Replace the key in `script.js` if needed

### Browser Compatibility

Ensure your hosting platform supports:
- Static file serving
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTTPS (for full functionality)

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Common Issues

1. **Voice Recognition Not Working**
   - Ensure your site is served over HTTPS
   - Check that the Web Speech API is supported by the user's browser

2. **API Errors**
   - Verify that the Mapillary API key is valid
   - Check that external APIs are accessible from your hosting environment

3. **CORS Issues**
   - Ensure your hosting provider doesn't block external API requests
   - Some free hosting providers may have restrictions

4. **File Path Issues**
   - Verify that all file paths in the HTML and CSS are correct
   - Ensure all assets are uploaded to the server

### Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test:
1. The main page loads correctly
2. All CSS styling is applied
3. JavaScript functionality works
4. Voice recognition is accessible (on HTTPS)
5. Location search returns results
6. 360Â° viewer loads and functions

## Updating Your Deployment

To update your deployed site:

1. **For GitHub Pages**
   - Push changes to your main branch
   - GitHub will automatically redeploy

2. **For Netlify/Vercel**
   - Push changes to your connected Git repository
   - The platform will automatically rebuild and deploy

3. **For Manual Deployments**
   - Re-upload the changed files to your server
   - Clear any server-side caches if necessary
